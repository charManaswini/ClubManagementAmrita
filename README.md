# ClubManagementAmrita
A Full-stack web development project that has been created for the Management of all clubs in our university, It is a basic project with a backend which uses MyPHP, and the front-end is created using HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap.
Also, it saves details of all students who have applied to the club, we have utilized a few existing project ideas and developed this new one, resources we have used are Git, and a few websites such as GeeksforGeeks, etc.,
To run the project, you are supposed to download all files, and then Install the Xammpp server (any version more than 3) and start the Apache and MySQL servers for the backend to store details, and the frontend can be edited using HTML, CSS, JS Text editors(Same with Bootstrap), I have used PHP for connectivity between the project, php files are shared in the repository, 
Thank you!
